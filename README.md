2) Download these github files.<br>
3) Extract the files into your OA folder.<br>
4) Double-click the install.cmd file to make the @DayZOriginsP folder.<br>
5) Set up your MySQL Server, create the Database "dayz_origins" (utf8 -- UTF-8 Unicode + utf8_general_ci) and execute my SQLfile\DayZ_Origins.sql on it.<br>
6) Also execute the db sql updates in the same folder.<br>
7) Edit the config.cfg and hive.ini in the folder "dayz_1.origins.tavi".<br>
8) Edit originsserver.cmd and change the path to your MySQL Server (it must be in the hidden path "Program Files")<br>
